Too many result in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153noise\u00e2\u20ac\u009d i.e. data which fluctuates wildly; too few means that the stereotypes are too \u00e2\u20ac\u0153averaged\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and become meaningless.<\/p>\n<p>There are two basic approaches to a segmentation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c <i>a priori<\/i> and <i>post-hoc<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><i>A priori<\/i> segmentations start from an assumption of meaningful categories (gender, age, ethnicity, life-stage, education, employment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or some combination) and then attach attributes to these categories from an analysis of the available data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><i>Post-hoc<\/i> segmentations do exactly the opposite: they start with the data and use various data-mining techniques to establish the categories. Once this has been achieved, the categories (and data) are examined in depth to understand the underlying meaning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what is it about those categories that make them significantly different?<\/p>\n<p>At Geo Strategies we specialise in <i>post-hoc<\/i> segmentations as we believe that these provide true insight into the market or group of people &amp;\/or behaviours of concern.<\/p>\n<p>Every organisation has a number of customer-based problems to address. Whether the concern is for customer acquisition, customer retention, up-sell, cross-sell, churn or risk, a well thought-through approach to segmentation will yield benefits far beyond the investment involved.<\/p>\n<p>The list below itemises some approaches:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Socio and geo-demographic segmentation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Where people live, their age, culture, household composition, behaviour, employment, finances and lifestyle extrapolations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Value segmentation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Current value, potential value, lifetime value, value deciles, contribution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Behavioural segmentation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Transactional data collected on how customers use products and services, including credit risk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Attitudinal &amp; needs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Core values, needs and reasons customers use products and services, usually identified through market research.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Preference segmentation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The channels, privacy and relationship people prefer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customer state segmentation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Time-based segments, showing a customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position in an event, process or relationship cycle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ephemeral segmentation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Segments in real-time to take advantage of fleeting opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><b>\u00c2\u00a0<\/b><b>Segmentations and market research<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Many companies rush into segmentation by starting with market research. Customers and prospective customers are asked what they want, need and do, and the research project then builds segmentation models.<\/p>\n<p>In our approach market research still has a key role to play; just a different one and at a later stage in the process. Use the initial analysis to define the customer segments to be researched and the \u00c2\u00a0reasons why. <i>Then <\/i>create a brief for market research and carry out the research based on the data-driven segments, ensuring at each stage that the outputs will be actionable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Geo Strategies undertakes demographic, attitudinal, behavioural, health and wealth segmentations of the Romanian population and elsewhere in CEE.
