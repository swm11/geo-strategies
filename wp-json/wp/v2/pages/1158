It is based on a simple proposition that the world&#8217;s cities share common patterns of residential segregation: each has their ghettos of Metropolitan Strugglers, suburbs of Career and Family and communities of Sophisticated Singles. In terms of their values and lifestyles each type of neighbourhood displays strong similarities in whichever country it is found. Using local data from 26 countries and statistical methods, Experian has identified 10 distinct types of residential neighbourhood, each with a distinctive set of values, motivations and consumer preferences, which can be found in each of the countries.<\/p>\n<p>For each Mosaic type in each country, the Index value for each of these variables (or close matching proxies) were extracted from the database that was used to create the national Mosaic classification system.\u00c2\u00a0 The Index shows how the variable compares with all the other types in that country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not in the world or in the countries for which Mosaic classifications have been built.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mosaic Global is a single, consistent classification that provides insight into the demographics, lifestyles and behaviours of 880 million people from the world&#8217;s population.
