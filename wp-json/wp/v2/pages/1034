This is particularly true for CRM and data warehousing applications where unclear structures and different formats reduce the value of data.<\/p>\n<p>Organisations that want to communicate effectively with their commercial partners must take steps to ensure that their data is structured correctly as everybody identifies closely with their own address.<\/p>\n<p>Addresses consist of multiple elements which all\u00e2\u20ac\u0090too\u00e2\u20ac\u0090often result in a variety of problems. Sometimes the capitalisation is wrong, sometimes addresses are spelt incorrectly or have the wrong abbreviation.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes they are based on names which have changed or names which are in the wrong word order. More mundanely, there are often spelling &amp;\/or typing errors.<\/p>\n<p>A particular problem which affects Romanian address data is missing or incorrect diacritics. Also databases which haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kept abreast of the changes from \u00c3\u00ae to \u00c3\u00a2.<\/p>\n<p>Geo Strategies has created an address cleansing and geocoding system specifically for Romania called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geo-address.com\">SMARTaddress<\/a>.
