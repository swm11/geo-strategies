The system classifies consumers into 45 neighbourhood types, aggregated into10 groups.<\/p>\n<p>Mosaic Romania has taken two years to build by a development team of over 40 researchers, geographers, surveyors, demographers, analysts, statisticians and consultants. The result is a classification that provides a comprehensive and detailed understanding of socio-demographics, lifestyles, culture and behaviour of the population and their neighbourhoods in Romania. <a href='https:\/\/www.southernwidehelicopters.com\/1xay48io\/'>\u00d8\u00a7\u00d8\u00b1\u00d9\u201a\u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u2026 \u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u201e\u00d8\u00b1\u00d9\u02c6\u00d9\u201e\u00d9\u0160\u00d8\u00aa<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Download the brochure for\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.geo-strategies.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/11\/mosaic-brochure.pdf\"><strong>Mosaic Romania<\/strong><\/a> to see what is available.<\/p>\n<p>Daniela Florea, CEO of Geo Strategies, said: &#8216;Developing Mosaic Romania has been a challenge. <a href='http:\/\/odontools.com.br\/ghtg2et\/'>\u00d8\u00a8\u00d8\u00b7\u00d9\u02c6\u00d9\u201e\u00d8\u00a7\u00d8\u00aa \u00d9\u2026\u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u2020 \u00d8\u00b3\u00d9\u0160\u00d8\u00aa\u00d9\u0160<\/a>  The relatively recent ability for people to choose the neighbourhoods in which they live, the fast-moving economy and, especially, the booming investment in retail and real estate are a few of the local influencers for this exciting new development. <a href='https:\/\/unemundo.com\/kjna03o\/'>\u00d9\u2026\u00d8\u00b3\u00d8\u00aa\u00d8\u00b6\u00d9\u0160\u00d9\u0081 \u00d9\u0160\u00d9\u02c6\u00d8\u00b1\u00d9\u02c6 2022<\/a> &#8216;<\/p>\n<p>Mosaic Romania is a powerful information tool, which is equally valuable across different market sectors.

We are very pleased that Mosaic Romania has taken its place amongst a global network of Mosaic consumer classifications that covers over 26 countries and over a billion consumers worldwide. It could not have arrived at a better time, just a few weeks before the country&#8217;s accession to the European Union.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>For further information on Mosaic Romania, under Resources, see &#8211;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.geo-strategies.com\/publications\/applications\/\">Publications<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.geo-strategies.com\/publications\/occasional-papers\/\">Papers<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Geo Strategies, in partnership with Experian have announced the development of their latest country-specific consumer classification with the launch of Mosaic Romania for consumer segmentation.
